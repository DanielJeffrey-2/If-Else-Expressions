#This program calculates what movies you can watch, depending on the age rating.

print('You want to find which movies you can watch? Just simply type in your age.')
a = int(input('Age:'))

if a >= 17:
 print('Wow! You can see an R rated movie!')

elif a >= 13:
 print('You can see a PG-13 movie all alone (Hence the name).')

elif a >= 5:
 print('You can see either a G or PG movie.')

else :
 print('You are not old enough to be using this.')  

print('Thanks for verifying your age.')
